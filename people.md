We are always looking for motivated researchers to join our group. If you are interested in pursuing quantitative or computational research in atmospheric and climate sciences, contact [Nicole Feldl](https://eps.ucsc.edu/faculty/Profiles/fac-only.php?uid=nfeldl) to find out how you can get involved. To get a sense for our group culture, consider reading the [Feldl group manual][fgm]. 

For prospective graduate students: Please apply to the graduate program in Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and also consider applying for a fellowship. For example: [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship][nsfgrfp], [NASA Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology Fellowship][nasa]. 

For prospective postdoctoral research fellows: Demonstrating your ability to pursue and fund independent research is especially important. Please let us know if you have an idea for a joint research proposal. In addition, the following fellowships are recommended: [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship][noaacgc], [NSF AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellowship][nsfprf], [James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship][jsmfpf], and the [UC President's Postdoctoral Fellowship][ucpres] for female and minority PhD recipients.
