We are always looking for motivated, qualified, and collaborative researchers to join our group. If you are interested in pursuing quantitative research in atmospheric or climate dynamics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, contact [Nicole Feldl](https://eps.ucsc.edu/faculty/Profiles/fac-only.php?uid=nfeldl) and include your CV and transcript. 

**For prospective graduate students:** Please apply to the [graduate program in Earth and Planetary Sciences][epsgrad] and also consider applying for the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship][nsfgrfp]. Feel free to reach out by email to give me a heads up that you've applied or if you have specific questions. Note that I find it most equitable, efficient, and helpful to chat with prospective students once applications have been submitted. Application fee waivers are available for qualified applicants and will not affect how your application is assessed.  

**For prospective postdoctoral researchers:** Please let us know if you have an idea for collaboration. The following fellowships are recommended: [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship][noaacgc], [NSF AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellowship][nsfprf], [James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship][jsmfpf], and the [UC President's Postdoctoral Fellowship][ucpres] for female and minority PhD recipients.
