We are always looking for motivated, qualified, and collaborative researchers to join our group. If you are interested in pursuing quantitative research in atmospheric or climate dynamics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, email [Nicole Feldl](https://eps.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=nfeldl) a brief statement of your research background and interests and include your CV and, if you are a student, transcript. Please also review the [group participation guide][guide].

**For prospective graduate students:** Please apply to the [graduate program in Earth and Planetary Sciences][epsgrad] and also consider applying for the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship][nsfgrfp]. Note that we find it most equitable, efficient, and helpful to chat by phone or Zoom *after* applications have been received. If the application fee is an undue burden, fee waivers are available (details in link above); this will not affect how your application is assessed.     
**I will not be recruiting students in the 2025-26 application cycle (to start Fall 2026).**

**For prospective postdoctoral researchers:** Please let us know if you have an idea for collaboration. The following fellowships are recommended: [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship][noaacgc], [NSF AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellowship][nsfprf], [Schmidt Science Fellowship][schmidt], and the [UC President's Postdoctoral Fellowship][ucpres] for female and minority PhD recipients.
