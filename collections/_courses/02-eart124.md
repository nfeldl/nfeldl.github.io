prompt: "This upper-division undergraduate course is a hands-on investigation of the climate system using numerical and mathematical models. Students gain experience using a variety of climate models, such as zero- and one-dimensional energy balance models and radiative-convective models, and they analyze the output from comprehensive climate simulations. Course objectives are to use models to build an understanding of the physical climate system; to learn principles of climate modeling, such as complexity and parametrization; and to gain substantial experience using the Python programming language."
