prompt: "An upper-division survey of the foundational concepts of physics, chemistry, and fluid dynamics relevant to the atmosphere. We also examine weather and climate phenomena including midlatitude cyclones, tropical cyclones, and climate variability and change. This quantitatively rigorous course emphasizes the use of calculus in problem sets, and we hone our skills in setting up atmospheric mass and energy balances and integrating differential equations."
