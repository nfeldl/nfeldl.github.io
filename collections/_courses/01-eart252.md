prompt: "A graduate-level, interdisciplinary investigation of the interaction between terrestrial systems and climate, with a focus on the cycling of water between atmosphere, land, and biosphere. Lecture topics include the global and regional energy balance, water balance, hydrologic partitioning, surface energy balance, evapotranspiration, and climate-vegetation dynamics. Complementary discussions of the scientific literature provide perspective on how these systems affect and are affected by climate change."
