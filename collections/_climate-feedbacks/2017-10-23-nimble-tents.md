Universities and Colleges, and their Libraries and Digital Scholarship Labs in
particular, have the latent capacity to gather quickly and react to the
urgencies we can expect from the anthropocene and our vulnerable political
landscapes: reams of good will, talent, space, colleague networks,
communication and management lines, pedagogical wherewithal, computational
savvy, and much more. The *nimble tents toolkit* provides timelines,
instructions and sample materials to help your team and organization tap into
that potential.

The toolkit was born of our [Puerto Rico
Mapathon](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/events/puerto-rico-mapathon.html).
Beyond mapathons, we feel our cultural and academic institutions can rapidly
respond to other events, so we are preparing as well pages for Data Rescue,
Quick Bibliographies, and events to fight hate on campuses. Please visit [The
Nimble Tents Toolkit](https://nimbletents.github.io/) site to stay abreast.
