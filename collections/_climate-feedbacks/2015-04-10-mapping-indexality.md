This project interprets the text of _The Arcades Project_ as a collection of
indexical gestures, reading instances of linguistic deixis as concretized
moments of textual interiority. According to Charles Sanders Peirce, the word
"this" is a certain type of index, which "calls upon the hearer to use his
powers of observation, and so establish a real connection between his mind and
the object." Within a textual setting, the word "this" takes on a different
kind of identity. Couched in a grammatical context, it becomes a marker of
intratextual reference and a signifier of its own position. It embodies
something close to a textual consciousness capable of remembering,
anticipating, and referring to itself.

Given the context-dependent meaning of deixis and the subjecthood implicit to
its operation, this project endeavors to track every instance of the word
"this" in _The Arcades Project_, classify the context of each instance along
distinct spatial and temporal axes, and visually represent each convolute as a
meandering path through time and space in a manner resonant with Benjamin's
description of the fl√¢neur. The spatial movement evoked by the deictic
instance, along with the temporal movement represented in linguistic modality
and tense, forms the basis of each trajectory.
