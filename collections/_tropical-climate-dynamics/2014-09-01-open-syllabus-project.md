### Opening the Curricular Black Box

In late January of 2016, we were a part of a group of scholars at Columbia and
Stanford Universities who unveiled the [Open Syllabus
Explorer](http://explorer.opensyllabusproject.org/)---an online tool that
aggregates data from over one million syllabi collected from college and
university websites. So far the Syllabus Explorer does only a few things: It
shows how often works are taught, what works are taught together, and where
and in what field they’re taught. But we think it has the potential to evolve
into something more powerful: a tool that can help us better reflect on the
formation of our intellectual legacies and, in the process, improve the
quality of higher education globally.

Building on the work of scholars like Dan Cohen, Alison Head, Jeffrey Schnapp,
and David Weinberger, the Explorer offers a **rich empirical account of
teaching across colleges and universities**, and, when the data is good
enough, at a state-by-state and institution-by-institution level. It offers
**new way to study the spread of ideas** as well as a **novel impact metric
based on how often works are taught**---introducing some much-needed
complexity into metrics based solely on citation counts. As we improve the
ability to sort by date, the Explorer will help tell stories about the
evolution of fields, the formations of canons, and the teaching trajectories
of individual works. As we improve the location filters, it will be possible
for university presses to understand when and where their catalogs are taught,
leveling the data playing field for small presses. Libraries will be able to
use the data to refine acquisition strategies. Faculty will be able to use it
as an aid to course planning.

The moment of building new infrastructures is always fraught as values and
policy choices solidify into servers, wires, buildings, and jobs. We think we
are faced with such a moment, in which we have the capacity to create a
valuable new public good out materials that we already own and care deeply
about. Over time, a Syllabus Commons can grow through individual faculty
donation or---more rapidly and with deeper historical reach---through access
to syllabus archives maintained by many institutions. In either case we need
your support. Let's build a Syllabus Commons.
