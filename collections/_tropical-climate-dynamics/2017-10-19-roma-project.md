*The Roma People’s Project* is a start-up initiative which aims to address 
misconceptions as well as foster research and public education
about the Roma people and culture. At core of our project is the Roma Digital
Archive--a platform that identifies, examines, and curates material about how
Roma define themselves and how others have represented them. 

Most people know so little about the Roma that the very word is often alien to
them. However, the term “Gypsy” (as well as “Travelers”) is more widely
recognized and often serves as the only point of reference. Yet, the word
conjures images of horse thieves or pickpockets that tourists are warned about
in Europe, in addition to more romanticized images such as fortune-tellers
with a crystal ball or exotic women dancing barefoot near a caravan. 

While linguistic and genetic evidence suggests the Roma originated in Northern
India, they have been without a country or representation for 1,000 years. The
Roma People’s Project seeks to create a space for Roma and other marginalized
groups--ethnic or otherwise--to discuss their shared challenges and explore
how their identities enrich themselves and their societies.

The Roma People's Project at Columbia University launches on November 14th,
2017 in partnership with Center for Justice at Columbia University, [Heyman
Center for Humanities](http://heymancenter.org/events/the-roma-peoples-project-launch-and-discussion/),
Columbia University Libraries Digital Scholarship, and Columbia's Group for
Experimental Methods in the Humanities.
