How do we reduce the production cost for *sx:archipelagos* online peer reviewed
academic publication while preserving the quality of the longstanding print
journal *Small Axe*?

In our first encounter, Kaiama L. Glover (Associate Professor of French and
Africana Studies at Barnard College), Alex Gil and Kelly Josephs (Director,
York College Honors Program, and Associate Professor of English at CUNY)
presented on the new stage of development of *Small Axe: sx:archipelagos*, and
worked with xp-methods to re-imagine a workflow for the publication of academic
content around Dennis Tenenâ€™s and Grant Wythoff's "[Sustainable Authorship in
Plain Text using Pandoc and
Markdown](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)."

As pressures mount on academic journals, the need to reduce costs while
providing manageable workflows and multivalent outputs has increased. The
*[Small Axe](http://smallaxe.net/)* journal has weathered two decades as the
flagship journal for Caribbean Studies and thus provides a great platform for
experimentation around an established journal, as opposed to new experiments
that must build prestige while trying out new workflows.

*sx:archipelagos* was born as that experimental branch. The goal of *sx:a* is
to publish a combination of articles, digital project reviews, and digital
humanities ventures with low periodicity and under reduced cost.
