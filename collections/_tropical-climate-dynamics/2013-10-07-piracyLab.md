[piracyLab](http://piracylab.org/) was convened by the faculty, students, and
librarians involved in the [*Hacking the
Archive*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_Gts-FzjsdnOLcIMugq4B61uMGjiFOEzJ7ecEENSbo/edit?usp=sharing)
course taught in the spring of 2013 by Professors Matthew Connelly and Dennis
Tenen at Columbia University.

> piracyLab is an academic research collective exploring the impact of piracy
on the spread of knowledge around the world. Our work combines critical,
historical, and quantitative approaches to the study of illicit knowledge,
information “leaks,” and underground archives. We are interested in
understanding the ethics and the social dynamics of piracy in its legal,
technological, and socioeconomic contexts.
