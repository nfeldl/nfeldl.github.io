title: circulations-transport

<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

A valuable perspective on changes in *large-scale atmospheric circulations* is afforded by decomposing the atmospheric energy budget into energy flux changes (radiative forcing, feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake) and diagnosing the implied changes in poleward energy transports. These energy-transport changes in turn manifest in the changing atmospheric circulations, such as the magnitude and structure of the tropical Hadley circulation, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the midlatitude storm tracks, which are fundamental controls on regional climate and the hydrological cycle.
