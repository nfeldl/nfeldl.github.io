<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

The energetic perspective on the *changing atmospheric circulation* decomposes the atmospheric energy budget into energy flux changes (radiative forcing, feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake) and their implied changes in poleward energy transports. The energy transport changes in turn manifest in the changing atmospheric circulations, such as the magnitude and structure of the tropical Hadley circulation, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the midlatitude storm tracks, which are important controls on the hydrological cycle. Hence, such diagnostic decompositions may offer insights into robust aspects of climate projections and the source of spread among models.
