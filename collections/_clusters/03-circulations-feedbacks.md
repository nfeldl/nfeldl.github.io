<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

Radiative feedbacks interact with one another and with the dynamical components of the atmosphere and ocean. From the local energy balance of the atmosphere, we develop a diagnostic decomposition of poleward atmospheric energy transport changes into contributions from individual feedbacks, radiative forcing, and ocean heat uptake. Such energy transport changes manifest in the changing atmospheric circulations, influencing the magnitude and structure of the tropical Hadley circulation, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the midlatitude storm tracks, which are fundamental controls on regional climate and the hydrological cycle.
