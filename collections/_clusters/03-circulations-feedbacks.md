<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

Changes in poleward atmospheric energy transport manifest in the changing atmospheric circulations, such as the magnitude and structure of the tropical Hadley circulation, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the midlatitude storm tracks, which are fundamental controls on regional climate and the hydrological cycle. The energetic perspective on the changing large-scale atmospheric circulation focuses on interpreting changes in the equator-to-pole gradient of atmospheric energy. Feedbacks, by characterizing that anomalous gradient, enable a diagnostic decomposition of energy transport changes into contributions from individual feedbacks, radiative forcing, and ocean heat uptake, which we explore in this research.
