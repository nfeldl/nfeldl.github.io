<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

The poleward transport of energy by atmospheric and oceanic circulations plays a fundamental role in many characteristics of Earth's climate including climatological patterns of temperature and precipitation, their variability, and their changes in the future. We analyze the ways in which models are potentially biased relative to observations in their energy transport--specifically in the partitioning between atmosphere and ocean and in trends over the historical period--and the role of sub-seasonal variability in driving extreme heating events such as heat waves. Through this work, we develop a process-level understanding of the model physics at the global scale in order to assess the robustness of projected changes in energy transport and their climate impacts. This research is supported by the National Science Foundation under Award 2311541.
