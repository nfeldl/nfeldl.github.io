<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

*Serious Games for Climate Change* is a research cluster at the nexus of game design, climate science, and learning science. In collaboration with [Elizabeth Swensen][es] (Department of Performance, Play & Design), we seek to leverage the power of both games and models to promote the learning of complex topics through experimentation and play. Games additionally hold promise as tools for social empowerment, inspiring agency to advance climate solutions.
