<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

*Serious Games for Climate Change* is a research cluster at the nexus of game design, climate science, and learning science. In collaboration with [Elizabeth Swensen][es], Art and Design: Games and Playable Media, we seek to leverage the power of both games and models to promote the learning of complex topics through experimentation and play. Games additionally hold promise for increasing social empowerment, public investment, and policy engagement in climate solutions.
