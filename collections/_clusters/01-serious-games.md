*Serious Games for Climate Change* is a research cluster at the nexus of game design, climate science, and learning science. Our aims are to develop new ways to create better video games for learning about climate change, as well as games that increase public investment and policy engagement in California. Moderated by [Elizabeth Swensen][es], Art and Design: Games and Playable Media, and [Nicole Feldl][nf], Earth and Planetary Sciences.
