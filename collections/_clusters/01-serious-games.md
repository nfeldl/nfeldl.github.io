<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

*Serious Games for Climate Change* is a research cluster at the nexus of game design, climate science, and learning science. In collaboration with [Elizabeth Swensen][es] (Department of Performance, Play & Design), we create games that foster scientific thinking and promote the learning of complex topics through experimentation and narrative. Games additionally hold promise as tools for social empowerment, inspiring agency to advance climate solutions.
