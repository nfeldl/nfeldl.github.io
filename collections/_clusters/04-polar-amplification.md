<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

Since the 1970s, simulations of climate change forced by increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have predicted warming that is greatest in polar regions. This *polar-amplified warming* has been variously attributed to the ice-albedo feedback, associated with the retreat of reflective sea ice in summer; the lapse rate feedback, associated with vertically nonuniform atmospheric warming in winter; and changes in energy transport by atmospheric circulations. Uncertainty in projections of Arctic climate change arise in part from incomplete understanding of the interconnected nature of these processes, which we strive to disentangle through creative modeling experiments and novel statistical techniques.
