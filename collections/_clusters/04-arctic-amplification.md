<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

*Arctic amplification* is widely attributed to the sea-ice albedo feedback and the corresponding increase in absorbed solar radiation, yet an important, and underappreciated, contribution arises from the impact of the vertical structure of atmospheric warming on the Earth's outgoing radiation. Since the Arctic temperature profile may be influenced by a number of processes, this raises questions about the physical mechanisms ultimately responsible for the so-called lapse rate feedback. Our research activities in this cluster focus on creative modeling experiments designed to disentangle atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere impacts on high-latitude climate change, and novel statistical techniques capable of identifying causal mechanisms in any time series, observational or simulated.
