Walking can be a mode of analysis that encompasses text, body, and place. The *Embodied Space
Lab* incorporates **mobile methods of reading and map-making** into philology and
historiography. In the dialectic between body and space we trace apparent vectors of power,
technology, gender, class, and ethnicity and draw critical cartographies: ways of seeing and
reflecting on an embodied and embedded world. Moderated by [Moacir P. de SÃ¡ Pereira][mp],
Butler Library (Columbia University) and [Manan Ahmed][ma], Department of History (Columbia
University).
