In the tropics, changes in atmospheric heat transport with warming manifest as changes in the structure and strength of the Hadley circulation, with implications for tropical precipitation. We develop a diagnostic decomposition of the tropical circulation response that accounts for meridional gradients in radiative feedbacks, radiative forcing, and ocean heat uptake; energy transport by atmospheric eddies; and gross moist stability. The picture that emerges is one of complex local and remote interactions, motivating additional, idealized experiments. To that end, we impose systematic variations in the surface albedo feedback in an aquaplanet model to explore how uncertainty in polar feedbacks translates into uncertainty in the tropical circulation response.

<!-- The range of Hadley circulation weakening in these experiments is attributed to opposing drivers: surface abledo and cloud feedbacks increase the uncertainty while compensating changes in eddy energy transport decreases it -->
