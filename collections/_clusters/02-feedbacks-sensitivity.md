<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

Uncertainty in the magnitude and geographic pattern of climate change is dominated by divergent predictions among climate models. Model differences are closely linked to their representation ofÂ climate feedbacks, that is, the amplifying or stabilizing radiative fluxes that are caused by changes in clouds, water vapor, surface albedo, and other factors, in response to an external climate forcing. Progress in constraining this uncertainty is therefore predicated on understanding how individual climate feedbacks aggregate into a regional and global climate response.
