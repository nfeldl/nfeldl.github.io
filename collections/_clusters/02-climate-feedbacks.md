Uncertainty in the spatial pattern of climate change is dominated by divergent predictions among climate models. Model differences are closely linked to their representation of *climate feedbacks*, that is, the additional radiative fluxes that are caused by changes in clouds, water vapor, surface albedo, and other factors, in response to an external climate forcing. Progress in constraining this uncertainty is therefore predicated on understanding how patterns of individual climate feedbacks aggregate into a regional and global climate response.

We begin by presenting a framework for quantifying the zonal mean, equilibrium temperature response to radiative feedbacks and radiative forcing[^1],[^2]. This work illustrates both the importance of feedbacks other than the surface albedo feedback to polar amplification, as well as the pivotal role of atmospheric heat transport in balancing the energetic requirements of the feedbacks. The latter is a theme throughout this research cluster, that is, how do radiative feedbacks affect atmospheric dynamics? Additional research focuses on ocean processes[^3] and an in-depth, systematic investigation of interactions among feedbacks[^4].

The mechanism of polar amplification in the absence of surface albedo feedback is investigated using an atmospheric model coupled to an aquaplanet slab ocean forced by a CO2 doubling[^5]. There is a pervasive misconception, based on prior modeling studies, that substantial polar amplification may occur in the absence of sea ice loss. However, similar simulations[^4], albeit including a seasonal cycle, do not exhibit polar-amplified warming. To reconcile these apparently contradictory results, we examine the sensitivity of polar surface warming response under different insolation conditions, finding that a lack of insolation has the same effect as sea ice in stabilizing the atmosphere and therefore promoting a positive polar lapse rate feedback under warming. Hence, our results reveal that the simulation of polar amplification in the absence of sea ice is only possible under perpetual equinox conditionsâ€”an irrelevant insolation condition for the real Earth.

To understand how uncertainty in feedback patterns drives uncertainty in the patterns of temperature response, we employ a moist energy balance model (MEMB) that combines regional feedbacks and the diffusion of both latent and sensible heat. The MEBM accurately predicts zonal mean warming as simulated by general circulation models under increased CO2. Using both hypothetical uncertainty patterns[^6] and uncertainty patterns generated from CMIP5 simulations[^7], we find that whereas uncertainty in tropical feedbacks induces a global response, the impact of uncertainty in polar feedbacks remains predominantly regionally confined.
