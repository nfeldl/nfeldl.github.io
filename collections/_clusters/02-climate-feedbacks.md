<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

Uncertainty in the spatial pattern of climate change is dominated by divergent predictions among climate models. Model differences are closely linked to their representation of *climate feedbacks*, that is, the additional radiative fluxes that are caused by changes in clouds, water vapor, surface albedo, and other factors, in response to an external climate forcing. Progress in constraining this uncertainty is therefore predicated on understanding how patterns of individual climate feedbacks aggregate into a regional and global climate response. We begin by presenting a framework for quantifying the zonal mean, equilibrium temperature response to radiative feedbacks and radiative forcing. This work illustrates the pivotal role of atmospheric heat transport in balancing the energetic requirements of the feedbacks, and kicks off a theme throughout this clusterâ€”how do radiative feedbacks affect atmospheric dynamics? Additional investigations pursue in-depth, systematic investigations of interactions among feedbacks, question the mechanism of polar amplification in the absence of sea ice, and employ a moist energy balance model (the MEBM) that combines regional feedbacks and the diffusion of both latent and sensible heat to reveal how uncertainty in feedback patterns drives uncertainty in the patterns of temperature response
