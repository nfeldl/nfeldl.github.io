This periodical was Hunt’s most famous publication as editor in the first two
decades of the 19th-century, and the work that gave him a place of prominence
within the Romantic period. This talk will also engage with the challenges in
representing online Hunt's complex set of relationship within his overlapping
circles of writers, as well as the reviews of his central work in which he
(re)wrote his life. In doing so, I will also expand my discussion in the
second half of my presentation to considering the relevance of Digital
Humanities to humanities scholars at large, at both a theoretical and
practical level.
