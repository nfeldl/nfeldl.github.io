 Bichitra contains images of virtually all his manuscripts (47,500+
pages) and major print editions (91,500+ pages), with transcriptions, reading
texts, a hyperbibliography, a search engine cum hyperconcordance, and a novel
three-tier collation program. Its file management system and its use of a
non-Latin font also posed challenges. In fact, Bichitra provides a test case
for virtually all the challenges of creating a large textual database, along
with some major text-analysis programs. An account should interest all current
and future makers of textual databases in any language. There will also be
some reference to other Digital Humanities projects at the School of Cultural
Texts and Records, Jadavpur University.
