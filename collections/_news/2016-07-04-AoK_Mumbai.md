## Travel & Transportation:

If you are staying further away and plan to join the workshop, remember that
traffic can make transportation times far longer than expected. Take the
government pre-paid blue AC cabs from the airport or arrange transportation
with your hotel if you are arriving early.

## Weather:

It is monsoon season, and from all reports, this year there has been heavy
rain in Mumbai. That means all participants should be sure to bring plastic
bags or covers for their electronic devices, rain gear, and appropriate
attire, as shoes will definitely get wet from puddles.

## Accommodation:

1. Pre-Meeting (July 2-3): A number of participants is arriving for the
preliminary events at CAMP. We unfortunately do not have the budget to
reimburse accommodation for this period.

2. TISS workshop (July 3-7): We will provide housing for everyone who needs
accommodation for the period July 3rd through July 7th at the Tata Institute
of Social Sciences. We’ll be accommodating all participants in need of housing
at TISS in double occupancy dorm rooms. Please check with the front desk for
your room assignment and roommate. The nearby Fern Residency hotel is highly
recommended and is an option for those who can afford their own accommodation.
