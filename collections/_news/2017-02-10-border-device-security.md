Recent Executive Orders by President Trump have focused on surveillance and
examination of travelers' personal devices as well as their social media
history, contacts, and other information. In fact, United States is joining
similar efforts already instituted in Turkey, Pakistan, United Kingdom and
more. As academics and researchers engaged in active research and publication
around the world, we are especially vulnerable to these new legal
regimes--irrespective of our citizenship and legal status. Let us take some
measures to limit our vulnerabilities.

The workshop will be led by Prof. [Dennis
Tenen](http://english.columbia.edu/people/profile/453) (English & Comp. Lit)
and Prof. [Manan Ahmed](https://history.columbia.edu/faculty/manan-ahmed/)
(History) at the Butler Studio (208b).
