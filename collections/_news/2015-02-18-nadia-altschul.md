## On Philology

Philology and the reconstruction of texts has been a main humanistic method since the purported end of the middle ages. Todayâ€™s exchange will delve into the history of philology and its basic methodological assumptions, bringing to the fore some of its colonial underpinnings, and asking digital humanists, as part of the conversation, about connections between DH and this core method in humanities research.

Event is free and open to the public. Seating is first come, first served
