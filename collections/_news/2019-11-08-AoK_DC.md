We aim to begin thinking about, and building a digital archive focused on the history of U
Street. We will foreground the political, ethical and intellectual implications of collating
information in the modern digital economy. This ethos will  inform the technical infrastructure
of the project and shape the effort to build an archive that ensures data rights are retained
by the community itself. We will also host workshops for community members to learn a new
skills that will be vital to the process of documenting history.

Our two-day multi-sited community fair will focus on the pasts and presents of U Street's
immigrant histories, including and especially displaced former residents of the neighborhood.
During this fair, we hope to begin the conversations we need to have, as a community, to build
and design a collective archive and to alert stakeholders to the existence of this initiative.
An important part of this project is to build horizontal solidarities and sharing knowledge
with other communities undergoing similar processes of displacement and gentrification.

The main events planned so far include:

1. A Data DiscoTech to increase community data literacy hosted by the Detroit Community
   Technology Project.  A team led by Tawana Petty will host a variety of booths for community
members to learn about digital technologies.

2. A listening booth hosted by xpMethod to help us begin to think about oral histories of the
   neighborhood

3. A panel on community funding led by CLIR and Mellon

4. A presentation by Shellée Haynesworth's Black Broadway on U project; a walking tour guided
   by community elders; a community archiving hub; as well as events at the YMCA and other
locations in the neighborhood.
