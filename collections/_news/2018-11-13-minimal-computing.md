Have you ever been interested in publishing a small archive of manuscripts, art, photographs or
other primary sources on the web? Interested in learning about digital humanities? Have you
ever wanted to create your own web project from scratch? In this 4 part workshop series, Alex
Gil teaches how to build a web project that catalogues and presents digitized cultural
artifacts using Wax, a set of minimal computing approaches developed at Columbia University.
Minimal computing, broadly defined, refers to computing done under some set of significant
constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors. Wax is
a flexible framework and set of tools that allow you to create eminently durable and useful
digital archives without a database. To see an example of Wax in action you can visit the
[Style Revolution](https://stylerevolution.github.io/) built by graduate students in Art
History or the [Barbara Curtis Adachi Bunraku
Collection](https://bunraku.library.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University Libraries.
