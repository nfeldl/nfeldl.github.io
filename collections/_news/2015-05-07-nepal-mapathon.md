[Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) & The [Center for International History](http://cih.columbia.edu/) are proud to host:

Nepal Mapathon  
for Earthquake Relief  
May 7, 10-3 PM at Butler Library 208B  

Come help with relief efforts on the ground in Nepal by contributing your time
to open-source mapping.

Following the recent earthquake, people around the world are using the
OpenStreetMap platform to give their time to earthquake relief efforts.
[Kathmandu Living Labs](http://kathmandulivinglabs.org/), an organization in
Nepal, has been working with relief organizations in urban and rural areas and
updating mapping tasks on the [OSM Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/)
according to relief needs. During the mapathon, we will teach people how to
help with these relief efforts through mapping and we will map together.

No mapping experience necessary. No knowledge of local terrain is necessary.
Come any time during the day.

Please bring your laptop. RSVP

Nepal Mappathon is an example of our *Mobilized Humanities*. MH brings together digital tools to equip broad social awareness and help in global critical situations. We mobilize humanities faculties, libraries, and students with relevant language, archival, technical and social expertise to nimbly produce curated and applied knowledge. MH sits away from state and non-governmental organizations and is scholarship in an global context.
