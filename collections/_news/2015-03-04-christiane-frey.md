## The Poet, the Scientist, and the Bee: Before and Beyond the "Two Cultures"

In an oft-quoted simile, Bacon compares the yet-to-be established “new method” of scientific
inquiry to the way of the bee. It’s a telling comparison. From antiquity to the Renaissance,
the bee had served as an emblem not of the scientist or natural philosopher, but of the poet:
like a bee, the poet collects from the fruits of others to create something new. In figuring
the scientific method in these terms, Bacon situates science in a reservoir of procedures that
we would today attribute to the humanities. Christiane Frey's talk will explore the emergence
of the discourse of modern science from a language of natural philosophy that was not yet
subject to the modern divide between “poetic” and “scientific” forms of knowledge. The intent
is to gain new insight less into the separation of the “two cultures” than into the conditions
of their unavoidable entanglement.

Event is free and open to the public. Seating is first come, first served
