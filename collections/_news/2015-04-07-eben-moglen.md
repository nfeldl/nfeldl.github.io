location: "Butler Studio, 208b"
participants:
type: encounter
prompt: " Universities were the freest places in human society to compute—and therefore
to read, communicate and learn—from the beginning of computing until yesterday.
They are no longer. Mostly, you did it to yourselves. Some of it is being done
to you. In this post-Snowden talk, Eben Moglen, founder of the Software Freedom
Law Center and Professor at Columbia Law School, will discuss what has
happened, why you should not want to live this way one millisecond longer, and
how you can begin to reclaim your technological freedom in order to safeguard
your political liberty."
