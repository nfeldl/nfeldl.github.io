## Cabinet Logics: An Intellectual History of Book Furniture

Even “the cloud” that seems to float above us today relies on heavy
architecture for its operation. In this talk I’ll focus on the furniture we
design and build (or buy, or appropriate, or kludge together) to make, store,
support, organize, and preserve our bibliographic objects. These structures
scaffold our media technologies, inform the way human bodies relate to those
media, and embody certain assumptions about what and how we know things
through these objects. We’ll examine how these media-furnishings function as
material supports for the delivery of and engagement with media resources,
while they also frame organizational logics, access policies, and technical
protocols. We’ll discover how our task chairs, desks, shelves, and cabinets
give shape to epistemology, politics, and affect — how they render complex
intellectual and political ideas material, aesthetic, and empirical.
