“[Fabula and Sjužet in ‘Wandering
Rocks’](http://muziejus.github.io/wandering-rocks)” is a data visualization of
the events in the tenth episode of James Joyce’s _Ulysses_. It maps the events
both by the fabula (historical spacetime) and sjužet (narrative spacetime) to
show how both provide different points of entry into the episode.

The animation can be played both as the fabula, where events occur in
chronological order, and as the sjužet, where events occur in narrative order.

The data are available to serve as a model for rebuilding the project with
one’s own dataset.
