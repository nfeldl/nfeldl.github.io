In reference to schemas for Ulysses, Joyce describes the compositional
technique behind the “Sirens” episode as a “fugue with all musical
notations,”[^1] and as including the “eight regular parts of a fuga per
canonem.”[^2] Joyce uses the first 63 lines of the chapter to introduce 99
words and syllables that reappear in different forms throughout the rest of
the text. The sounds ultimately act as leitmotifs, evoking the sensory
presence of different characters at different times.

This visualization is constructed as a line-by-line annotation of each sound
that recurs at least four times following its initial introduction. Within
each line, each sound is grouped into repetitions, linked to its associated
character(s), and sorted into one of three possible tiers based on its
distance from the root sound. The pages are represented as columns.
