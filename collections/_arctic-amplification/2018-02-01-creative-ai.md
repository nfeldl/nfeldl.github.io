Literary theory can no more ignore the output of artificially intelligent
agents than the study of labor can ignore the advent of robotics.

*An Inquiry Concerning the Creative Limits of Artificial Intelligence* is a
book about the automation of labor in the literary sphere, as told through the
story of writers' aids past and present---narrative plotters, spell checkers,
and language generators---the "shameful little secrets" of mass literary
production.

In subsequent chapters I bring to view a number of algorithmic artifacts vital
to the advance of artificial intelligence, on a spectrum from quasi-autonomous
heuristics for combinatorial composition---style guides and "canned" literary
formulae---to fully-autonomous bots---of the sort used to manufacture junk
mail and disinformation campaigns on social media.
