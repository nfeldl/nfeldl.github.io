  text: "We compiled our training data (transcriptions from MS 198) and trained the OCR system *Kraken.* We then compiled ground-truth testing data and OCR'd different pages from MS 198 and four more manuscripts. The machine showed an accuracy rate of 90% on the training data, 85% on MS 198, and between 80% and 20% on the four other manuscripts (results varied greatly depending on the script, the layout, and the scribe)."

In collaboration with a [team of international scholars][1] at the Open
Islamicate Texts Initiative (OpenITI), our project aims to train an OCR system
on a corpus of medieval manuscripts. The engine developed by OpenITI, Kraken,
has a unique advantage in its line-based, rather than character-based,
recognition of text, which makes it especially suitable for the density and
occasional obscurity of Middle English handwriting.

We will train Kraken on a select set of manuscripts attributed to the same
scribe (“Scribe D”). These include the Corpus Christi MS 198, the Plimpton MS
265, and the London Library MS V. 88.  If successful, we would later train the
system on an even larger set of manuscripts. Such a tool would have immense
impact on medieval studies.  Scholars could more easily compare manuscripts
across a single textual tradition, or create digital editions for lesser-known
texts. Above all, it would allow them to work on a massive number of
untranscribed texts that seem “lost” on the current academic radar.
