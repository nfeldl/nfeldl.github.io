[@rikersbot](https://twitter.com/rikersbot) is a coding workshop and an
algorithmic storytelling project set in and about Rikers Island correctional
facility, New York City's main prison complex.

In the spring of 2015, the [Center for
Justice](http://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/) approached the [Group for
Experimental Methods](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) with an idea of running an
"Intro to [Python](https://www.python.org/)" workshop for the young people
incarcerated at Rikers and for Columbia University students interested in
digital literacy. Our goal was to set up the encounter in a way that moved past
one-way conversation and had effects that would persist beyond event itself.

In teaching programming through digital storytelling, we hoped to encourage
a dialog between the youth at Rikers, Columbia faculty and students, and the
larger community of the city.

The Rikers Bot project gives all participants a chance to have their voices
heard, to learn to code, and to gain real-world experience in writing, editing,
and producing a project. Together, we are building a [Twitter
bot](https://twitter.com/rikersbot) that will tell our story.
