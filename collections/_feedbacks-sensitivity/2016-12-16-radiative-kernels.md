Radiative kernels for the GFDL AM2.1 in its aquaplanet configuration with a seasonal cycle are available for download from [this repo](https://github.com/nfeldl/aquakernels) and are described in the following paper: Feldl, N., S. Bordoni, and T. M. Merlis (2017), Coupled high-latitude climate feedbacks and their impact on atmospheric heat transport, <i>Journal of Climate</i>, 30, 189â€“201, [doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0324.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0324.1).
