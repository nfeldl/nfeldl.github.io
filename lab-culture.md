We would like to maintain a conscious and engaged environment in the lab that supports all members. With this goal in mind, we actively promote the following practices:

1. Grants and fellowships - Write proposals. External funding leverages group resources and develops individual grant writing skills.

2. Research design and execution - Collaborate on research projects at all stages, from initial design through to execution. This includes refinement of ideas that may be taken with members when they leave the group.

3. Presence - Meet weekly to discuss progress and plans. Be available in the lab/office for a minimum pre-arranged set of hours to facilitate interactions.

4. Broader engagement - Attend department seminars and meet with guest speakers.

5. Publication and presentation - Publish findings in leading academic journals. Prioritize the exposure of junior colleagues. Conduct internal review of all professional products. For PhD students: Prepare and submit three manuscripts prior to graduation and present talks or posters at one conference per year.

6. Career planning - Discuss future career goals, inside or out of academia, and plan ways to achieve them.
